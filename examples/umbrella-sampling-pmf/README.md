# Example illustrating the application of MBAR to compute a 1D PMF from an umbrella sampling simulation.

The data represents an umbrella sampling simulation for the chi torsion of a valine sidechain in lysozyme L99A with benzene bound in the cavity.

# Usage

Run the included `umbrella-sampling.py` code.  `umbrella-sampling.sample_output` gives the expected output of the program.

The code `umbrella-sampling-smoothpmf.py` demonstrates significant additional functionality (in beta), but takes significantly longer to run.
